# Use this file to define placeholder models for the API documentation.
# These models are not used in the actual API implementation, as they are replaced with the
# actual models using <schemaMappings> within the `openapi-generator-maven-plugin` of `pom.xml`.
#
# Such placeholders are required for GitHub Actions to pass api-lint checks.
# Each placeholder model must have the same name as the actual model, and must contain at least
# one property, so it is not recognized as a simple Object after generating the resource interfaces.
